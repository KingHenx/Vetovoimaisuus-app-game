# Vetovoimaisuus-app-game
App/Game I made as a client project for the Vetovoimala project (Vetovoimala.fi) to be used in their event. “Mood ring” type app which "scan's" users hand and tells what kind of person user is depending on their hand size and speed of removing hand from the screen.

Game requires touchscreen to be able to "scan" anything

-Android build
-I can send you invite link for IOS build if needed
